# Problem Context

## Who is speaking?
Community members, citizens, or local stakeholders who report issues related to:
- Environment (pollution, erosion, deforestation)
- Governance (delayed responses, miscommunication)
- Infrastructure (waste management, public services)

## What are they saying?
Messages often include complaints, observations, suggestions, or concerns.  
They are usually unstructured and vary in tone, urgency, and clarity.

## Who is listening?
NGOs, local authorities, community organizers, and policymakers who need to act on this feedback.

## What breaks?
- Important issues get lost among long or repeated messages.
- Institutions struggle to prioritize urgent concerns.
- Aggregated patterns (recurring problems) are not easily visible.
- Communication is delayed, unclear, or ineffective.

## Why it matters
When feedback is missed or misunderstood:
- Communities feel ignored, reducing trust.
- Decisions are made without a full understanding of needs.
- Environmental and civic issues worsen due to delayed action.

## Solution Approach (Preview)
- Collect feedback in a structured table (Airtable).  
- Use low-code automation (Make.com) to send messages to an LLM.  
- Categorize, summarize, and highlight urgent issues.  
- Export structured insights for decision-makers.  

This approach ensures that **communication flows effectively**, enabling timely and informed action.
