# public-feedback-analyzer
## Overview
This project explores how NLP and large language models can help
structure unorganized public feedback into clear, actionable insights.

## Problem
Public feedback on environmental and civic issues is often scattered,
unstructured, and difficult for institutions to process at scale.

## Goal
To demonstrate how communication-focused NLP systems can summarize,
categorize, and highlight key public concerns.

## Scope
This is a research and communication-focused prototype, not a production system.
