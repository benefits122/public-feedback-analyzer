# Public Feedback Analyzer (NLP + LLM)

## Overview
Public feedback on environmental, civic, and governance issues is often scattered, unstructured, and difficult for institutions to process at scale.  
This project demonstrates how low-code automation and Large Language Models (LLMs) can structure community feedback into clear, actionable insights.

## Problem
Communities generate valuable feedback through surveys, social media, and forms. However:
- Messages are **unstructured** and inconsistent in tone.
- Institutions often **miss important signals** due to volume.
- Urgent or recurring issues are hard to identify quickly.

This creates **communication gaps** that hinder responsive governance and problem-solving.

## Goal
To design a system that:
1. Collects public feedback efficiently.
2. Analyzes and categorizes messages using NLP techniques.
3. Summarizes key insights using LLMs.
4. Provides structured reports that inform decisions.

## Scope
- Low-code and automation-focused solution (Airtable + Make.com + LLM API).  
- Focus on demonstrating communication-driven impact rather than production-level software.  
- Includes documentation, sample data, and workflow designs.

## Outcome
By the end of the project, the system will turn scattered feedback into actionable insights, improving understanding, accountability, and decision-making.
